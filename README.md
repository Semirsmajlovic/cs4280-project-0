Project 1

Description: 
In this program you will be writing a program to build a tree and print it using different traversals.

- Project Link: https://umsystem.instructure.com/courses/120697/assignments/1216590

Instructions:
In this project, there are three ways to run this program. Using the below commands inside a terminal or prompt will execute the specific task associated with that command.

- Build using input:
--- `./P0 {input}` - This takes an input from the user. Once you've completed the input, cancel out the current input session.

- Build using file:
--- `./P0 file` - Input the file name WITHOUT the extensions, since this can be bypassed and is handled in the code.

- Build using redirection:
--- `./P0 < file.sp2022` - Input the file name WITH the extension, since this isn't handled in the code.

Details:
The inputs are accounted to handle numbers also based on the same file inputs provided, along with additional strings.
